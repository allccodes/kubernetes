# ClusterIP

Ports are acessible inside the pod
Ex: Pod1 (3000) -> Pod1 (9000)
The pod gest an IP from the range that is addressed to the node


# Headless

Client wants to talk with one specific pod directly
Use case: statefull applications, like databases (pode replicas are not identical, each one has its individual state: ex: master-slave replica)
How client knows the IP of each pod?
- By dnslookup (Set the clusterIP configuration to None returns the pod IP instead the clusterIP has normaly does)
    clusterIP: None


# NodePort

Creates a service that is accessible on a static port on each worker node.
Not very safe because we are opening a port directly in each worder node.
Nota that we still have the Port of the service itself (NodePort -> Port) And the NodePort must match the port where the aplication container inside
the port is listening


# LoadBalancer

A service became accessible externaly throught a cloud provider LoadBalancer (the entry point is the load LoadBalancer)
